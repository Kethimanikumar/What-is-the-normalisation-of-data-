Data transformation operations, such as normalization and aggregation, are additional data preprocessing procedures that would contribute toward the success of the data extract process.

Data normalization consists of remodeling numeric columns to a standard scale. Data normalization is generally considered the development of clean data. Diving deeper, however, the meaning or goal of data normalization is twofold:

Data normalization is the organization of data to appear similar across all records and fields.
It increases the cohesion of entry types, leading to cleansing, lead generation, segmentation, and higher quality data.
